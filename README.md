# Best_Errors

## [better_errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors) and [binding_of_caller](https://github.com/banister/binding_of_caller): together at last!

Tired of wearing your fingers down to a nubbin from requiring **both** `better_errors` and `binding_of_caller` in the Gemfile for **every** Rails project?

Then this gem is for you!

# Installation

Put *this* in your Gemfile and bundle it:

```ruby
  gem 'best_errors'
```

# What is [better_errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors)?

It's a [beautiful](https://i.imgur.com/6zBGAAb.png) replacement for Rails' default error page.

# What is [binding_of_caller](https://github.com/banister/binding_of_caller)?

It's a gem that lets `better_errors` have a REPL on the errors page!

# O SHI!! THAT'S A WINNING COMBINATION!

I KNOW!
